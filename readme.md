## GoIT Node.js Course Template Homework

Fork this repository to complete homework assignments (2-6). Forking will create a repository on your account at [GitHub](http://github.com).

Add your mentor as a collaborator.

For each homework assignment, create a new branch.

- hw02
- hw03
- hw04
- hw05
- hw06

Each new branch for an assignment should be created from the master branch.

After completing the homework assignment on your branch, create a pull request (PR). Then add your mentor for code review. Only after the PR is approved by the mentor can you merge the homework branch into the master branch.

Carefully read the mentor's comments. Address the feedback and commit the changes to the homework branch. The changes will automatically appear in the PR after pushing the commit with the fixes to GitHub. After making the corrections, add the mentor for another review.

- When submitting the homework, provide the link to the PR.
- The JS code is readable and understandable, and Prettier is used for formatting.

### Commands:

- `npm start` — runs the server in production mode
- `npm run start:dev` — runs the server in development mode
- `npm run lint` — runs code linting with ESLint, should be executed before each PR and all linting errors should be fixed
- `npm lint:fix` — same as above, but also automatically fixes simple errors.
